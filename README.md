# AIA-Excel-Tool
A VBA-based Excel-Tool for Windows thats allows to send exchange requirements like general project information, classifications, properties, project location and IFC-Export information to ArchiCAD 25.

The tool was created as part of a master's thesis at the Bauhaus University in Weimar.

To use the tool, only the zip file has to be downloaded and unpacked. The Excel file can then be opened and edited. If the input is complete, the information entered can be exported as an XML file via the XMLExport button. These files can then be imported into ArchiCAD 25 at the appropriate point. 

The tool has a start page with helpful information. However, this information is only available in German.
